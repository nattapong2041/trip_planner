# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Activity Image Management feature extends the existing Trip Planner application by allowing users to add, view, and manage images for activities. This feature enables users to attach up to 5 images per activity to better visualize and document their planned activities. The system will handle image compression, storage via Firebase Storage, and provide an intuitive interface for image management within the existing activity workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Addition to Activities

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add images to my activities, so that I can visually document and share what we plan to do.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views an activity detail screen THEN the system SHALL display an image gallery section
2. WHEN a user taps the "Add Image" button THEN the system SHALL present options to select from camera or photo library
3. WHEN a user selects an image source THEN the system SHALL open the appropriate picker (camera or gallery)
4. WHEN a user selects an image THEN the system SHALL add it to the activity's image collection
5. WHEN an activity has images THEN the system SHALL display them in a horizontal scrollable gallery

### Requirement 2: Image Limit and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to manage image limits, so that storage is used efficiently and the interface remains clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an activity has fewer than 5 images THEN the system SHALL show the "Add Image" button
2. WHEN an activity reaches 5 images THEN the system SHALL hide the "Add Image" button
3. WHEN a user attempts to add a 6th image THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the 5-image limit
4. WHEN displaying the image count THEN the system SHALL show "X of 5 images" in the gallery header
5. WHEN an activity has no images THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder with "Add images to visualize this activity"

### Requirement 3: Image Compression and Size Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want images to be automatically optimized, so that they upload quickly and don't consume excessive storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an image larger than 3MB THEN the system SHALL automatically compress it before upload
2. WHEN compressing an image THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratio and visual quality
3. WHEN compression is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with "Optimizing image..." message
4. WHEN compression fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and not add the image
5. WHEN an image is under 3MB THEN the system SHALL upload it without compression

### Requirement 4: Firebase Storage Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my activity images to be securely stored and accessible across devices, so that all collaborators can view them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is added THEN the system SHALL upload it to Firebase Storage under the path `/activities/{activityId}/images/{imageId}`
2. WHEN uploading an image THEN the system SHALL generate a unique filename using UUID
3. WHEN an image upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL display upload progress
4. WHEN an image upload completes THEN the system SHALL store the download URL in the activity's images array
5. WHEN an image upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 5: Image Display and Gallery

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view activity images in an attractive gallery, so that I can easily browse and appreciate the visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an activity has images THEN the system SHALL display them in a horizontal scrollable gallery
2. WHEN a user taps on an image THEN the system SHALL open it in full-screen view with zoom capabilities
3. WHEN in full-screen view THEN the system SHALL allow swiping between images
4. WHEN displaying images THEN the system SHALL show loading placeholders while images load
5. WHEN an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a broken image placeholder with retry option

### Requirement 6: Image Deletion

**User Story:** As a user, I want to remove images from activities, so that I can manage and update the visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user long-presses on an image THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with "Delete" option
2. WHEN a user selects "Delete" THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
3. WHEN deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL remove the image from Firebase Storage and the activity's images array
4. WHEN an image is deleted THEN the system SHALL update the gallery display immediately
5. WHEN the last image is deleted THEN the system SHALL show the empty state placeholder

### Requirement 7: Collaborative Image Management

**User Story:** As a collaborator, I want to add and view images added by other trip members, so that we can collectively build a visual representation of our activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any collaborator adds an image THEN the system SHALL make it visible to all trip collaborators in real-time
2. WHEN displaying images THEN the system SHALL show who added each image and when
3. WHEN a collaborator deletes an image they added THEN the system SHALL remove it for all users
4. WHEN a user views an image THEN the system SHALL display the contributor's name in the image metadata
5. WHEN multiple users add images simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent uploads without conflicts

### Requirement 8: Image Metadata and Attribution

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see who added each image and when, so that I can understand the contribution history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is added THEN the system SHALL store the uploader's user ID and timestamp
2. WHEN displaying image details THEN the system SHALL show "Added by [User Name] on [Date]"
3. WHEN viewing the image gallery THEN the system SHALL display a small avatar of the contributor on each image
4. WHEN multiple images are from the same user THEN the system SHALL group them visually
5. WHEN displaying timestamps THEN the system SHALL use relative time format (e.g., "2 hours ago", "yesterday")

### Requirement 9: Simple Error Handling and Image Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want simple error handling for failed uploads and cached image display, so that the app works smoothly without complex offline features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow manual retry
2. WHEN viewing images THEN the system SHALL use cached_network_image for automatic caching and loading states
3. WHEN an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL show a placeholder with retry option
4. WHEN a user retries a failed upload THEN the system SHALL attempt the upload again
5. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 10: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want image operations to be fast and responsive, so that adding images doesn't slow down my planning process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the activity screen THEN the system SHALL display image thumbnails within 2 seconds
2. WHEN adding an image THEN the system SHALL show immediate feedback and progress indicators
3. WHEN scrolling through the image gallery THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance
4. WHEN opening full-screen view THEN the system SHALL load high-resolution images progressively
5. WHEN the app is backgrounded during upload THEN the system SHALL continue uploads and show completion notification
