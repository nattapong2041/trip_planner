# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Trip Planner with Friends application is a collaborative travel planning platform that enables users to brainstorm, organize, and plan trips together. The app allows friends to collectively suggest destinations, activities, and create structured day-by-day itineraries. Built as an MVP with Flutter and Firebase, it supports web, mobile, and tablet platforms while maintaining simplicity and scalability.
